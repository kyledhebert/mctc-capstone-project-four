# Project Four

Project Four is a Django application that uses the Open Secrets, VoteSmart, and NPR News APIs. 

## Description 
This application is a group project built as part of my software development capstone course at Minneapolis Community and Technical College. Our goals for the project were to explore consuming APIs using the Django framework.

## Features
Allow users to explore the contributions made to United States Congressional legislators, alongside position rankings from VoteSmart and recent news articles about the candidate from NPR.
